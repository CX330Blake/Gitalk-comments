## Who am I?
Welcome to CX330BLΛKΞ's Universe! You may be wondering who I am. Well, let me introduce myself to you.

In my senior year of high school, I was a student in the humanities stream. I had a strong interest in law and originally planned to pursue a degree in law. However, while preparing for exams, I stumbled upon my growing fascination with the field of cybersecurity. Consequently, I made the firm decision to change my course and aim for a degree in computer science with a focus on cybersecurity.

Currently, I am diligently enhancing my skills in cybersecurity, which includes engaging in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, working on vulnerable machines, and more. I aspire to become a cybersecurity professional who not only possesses technical expertise but also maintains a humanistic approach.
